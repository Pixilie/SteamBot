Version: 1.1.1  
By: Kristen  
The bot is not currently hosted, but I am working on it. You can still add it to your server.

## Presentation
SteamBot is a Discord bot created using the Discord.js library that provides you with interesting and useful statistics about your Steam profile, including the amount of time you've spent playing games, the number of games you own, and more.

## Informations
The bot is currently on version 1.1.1 and may still have some bugs. If you have any suggestions or would like to report a bug, you can contact me through Discord (my tag is Kristen#1827) or by email at pixilietv@gmail.com. You can also join my Discord server at https://discord.gg/wcy22GAmDG to discuss the bot or share feedback.
